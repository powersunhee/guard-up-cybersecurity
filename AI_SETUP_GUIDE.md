# 🤖 Guard Up - Real AI API Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Guard Up app is designed to work both with sophisticated local AI responses AND real OpenAI API integration. This guide shows you how to enable the premium AI features.

## 💰 Cost Estimation
**OpenAI API Pricing (as of 2024):**
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens
- **Typical conversation**: 100-500 tokens
- **Estimated cost**: $0.20-$2.00 per 100 conversations

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Sign up/login to your account
3. Navigate to **API Keys** section
4. Click **"Create new secret key"**
5. Copy your key (starts with `sk-...`)
6. **Important**: Add billing method in OpenAI dashboard

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Quickest)
```bash
# Your deployment folder is ready:
cd /Users/sunheekim/Documents/demo1
zip -r guard-up-with-ai.zip public/ netlify/ netlify.toml _redirects
```

1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Drag the `guard-up-with-ai.zip` file
3. Wait for deployment

#### Option B: Git Integration (Recommended for updates)
1. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Guard Up with AI integration"
git remote add origin your-github-repo-url
git push -u origin main
```

2. Connect to Netlify:
   - Go to Netlify → "New site from Git"
   - Connect your repository
   - Build settings:
     - **Build command**: `echo "No build needed"`
     - **Publish directory**: `public`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **Site settings**
2. Click **Environment variables**
3. Add new variable:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenAI API key (sk-...)
4. **Important**: After adding, click **"Trigger deploy"** to rebuild

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

1. Visit your deployed site
2. Open the AI chat assistant
3. Ask: "What AI features are available?"
4. You should see one of these responses:

**✅ AI API Working:**
```
"I'm now powered by OpenAI's advanced AI! I can provide personalized analysis..."
```

**❌ Fallback Mode:**
```
"Using built-in responses - for advanced AI features, configure OpenAI API key..."
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Model Selection
In `/netlify/functions/chat.js`, line 78:

```javascript
// For better quality (higher cost):
model: 'gpt-4'

// For faster/cheaper responses:
model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo'  // Default
```

### Token Limits
Current settings (line 79-82):
- **max_tokens**: 500 (good balance)
- **temperature**: 0.7 (creative but focused)

### Cost Control
Add monthly spending limits in OpenAI dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → Billing
2. Set "Usage limits" 
3. Recommended: Start with $10/month

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### API Key Security
- ✅ Store in Netlify environment variables
- ✅ Never commit to code repository  
- ✅ Regenerate if compromised
- ✅ Monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard

### Rate Limiting
The function includes automatic error handling for:
- Rate limits exceeded
- Quota exceeded  
- Invalid API keys
- Network errors

## 🔄 Hybrid Mode (Recommended)

Your app is set up in "hybrid mode":
1. **Tries AI API first** - for premium responses
2. **Falls back to local** - if API unavailable
3. **Always functional** - users never see errors

This means:
- ✨ Premium experience when API is available
- 🛡️ Reliable fallback when it's not
- 💰 Cost control (only pay for API calls)

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### OpenAI Dashboard
Monitor your usage at [OpenAI Usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage):
- Daily token usage
- Cost breakdown
- Rate limit status

### Netlify Functions
Check function logs in Netlify dashboard:
- Site overview → Functions tab
- View real-time logs
- Monitor errors/performance

## 🚀 Going Live Checklist

- [ ] OpenAI API key obtained and funded
- [ ] Environment variable configured in Netlify
- [ ] Site redeployed after adding API key
- [ ] AI chat tested and working
- [ ] Spending limits set in OpenAI dashboard
- [ ] Error handling tested (temporarily remove API key)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Set a low spending limit initially
2. **Monitor Usage**: Check costs weekly at first
3. **User Education**: Let users know they have premium AI features
4. **Fallback Testing**: Regularly test without API key to ensure local responses work
5. **Model Switching**: Use GPT-3.5 for general chat, GPT-4 for complex analysis

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" 
- Check environment variable spelling: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Redeploy after adding the variable
- Verify API key is valid in OpenAI dashboard

### "Quota exceeded"
- Add billing method in OpenAI dashboard
- Check spending limits
- Verify account is in good standing

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Normal for free tier, upgrade to paid
- Implement request queuing (advanced)
- Use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4

### Functions not deploying
- Check `netlify.toml` configuration
- Verify `package.json` in functions folder
- Check Netlify function logs for errors

## 📞 Support

If you need help:
1. Check Netlify function logs first
2. Verify API key in OpenAI dashboard  
3. Test with local responses to isolate issue
4. Check OpenAI status page for outages
